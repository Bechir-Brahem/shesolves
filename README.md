## Presentation

shesolves is an all girls competitive programming competition aimed to encourage women to participate in programming contests.  
shesolves was held in INSAT and it is an event by ACM insat and IEEE WIE insat. A team of problem setters helped prepare these problems.  

## problems

you can find the final version of the pdfs ![here](https://github.com/Bechir-Brahem/shesolves/tree/main/Problem%20Set%20-%20Final/PDFs)  

The problems cover a wide range of topics: prefix sums, binary search, recursion, implementation, prime numbers, two pointers and sliding window...  

two problems couldn't be solved at the end of the competition:
